### Welcome to My GitHub World

Hey! It's nice to meet you!

I'm Yifan, an applied math student and research assistant at the University of Waterloo, specializing in computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

ðŸ”­ Work: I am presently employed as a research assistant at the University of Waterloo, where my work focuses on projects involving river ice classification and the application of machine learning models to solve PDE operators. My enthusiasm lies in exploring inventive solutions and pushing technological boundaries.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced techniques in machine learning, deep learning, and mathematical modeling to enhance my skills and knowledge.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that involve computer vision, machine learning, and data science. If you have an exciting project in mind, feel free to reach out!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to applied math, computer vision, or machine learning. I'm always eager to share my knowledge and learn from others.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at quyf0516@outlook.com or connect with me on discord "maruko9085".

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

âš¡ Fun fact: Besides work, I have a lot of hobbies. I started learning ballet at the age of 4, began playing piano at 6, picked up figure skating and photography during COVID, and I'm always curious about everything beautiful in the world. I love traveling to new places and enjoy the thrill of discovering something new. I'm constantly learning and making new friends from all corners of the globe.
